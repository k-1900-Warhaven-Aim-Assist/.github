## 🎮 What Is Aim Assist in Warhaven?

**Aim assist** is a lighter, stealthier version of an aimbot. It gently adjusts your crosshair toward targets without hard snapping. The idea is to **help your natural aim**, not replace it entirely.

It’s a favorite among stream-safe hackers and players who want that *subtle edge* in PvP — especially in mid to long-range fights.

## 🔥 Top Features of Warhaven Aim Assist

### 🧲 Soft Lock

Smoothly guides your crosshair toward enemies inside a specific FOV radius. Feels like a controller aim magnet but for PC.

Choose head, neck, chest, or random zones for even more “legit” gameplay style.

Once activated, aim assist monitors your crosshair and nearby enemies. When your reticle moves near a target (inside FOV), it **gently pulls** toward the enemy’s hitbox, helping you stay locked without obvious tracking.

You still aim — it just corrects your aim silently and subtly.
